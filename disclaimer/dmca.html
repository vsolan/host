DMCA Notice and Takedown Policy and Procedures

eroticvintage.ga takes matters of Intellectual Property very seriously and is committed to meeting the needs of content owners while helping them manage publication of their content online. It should be noted that eroticvintage.ga is a simple search engine of videos available at a wide variety of third party websites.

 

Any videos shown on third party websites are the responsibility of those sites and not eroticvintage.ga. We have no knowledge of whether content shown on third party websites is or is not authorized by the content owner as that is a matter between the host site and the content owner. eroticvintage.ga does not host any content on its servers or network.

 

 

Content owners must understand that by having a link removed from eroticvintage.ga they will not be removing the actual source video from the 3rd party site. Content owners must contact the video hosting site themselves to request removal.

 

This website (eroticvintage.ga) qualifies as a “Service Provider” within the meaning of 17 U.S.C. § 512(k)(1) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”). Accordingly, it is entitled to certain protections from claims of copyright infringement under the DMCA, commonly referred to as the “safe harbor” provisions. We respect the intellectual property of others, and we ask our users to do the same. Accordingly, we observe and comply with the DMCA, and have adopted the following Notice and Take down Policy relating to claims of copyright infringement by our customers, subscribers or users.

Take Down Procedure

The SITE implements the following “notification and takedown” procedure upon receipt of any notification of claimed copyright infringement. The SITE reserves the right at any time to disable access to, or remove any material or activity accessible on or from any SITE or any Materials claimed to be infringing or based on facts or circumstances from which infringing activity is apparent. It is the firm policy of the SITE to terminate the account of repeat copyright infringers, when appropriate, and the SITE will act expeditiously to remove access to all material that infringes on another’s copyright, according to the procedure set forth in 17 U.S.C. §512 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”). The SITE’s DMCA Notice Procedures are set forth in the preceding paragraph. If the notice does not comply with §512 of the DMCA, but does comply with three requirements for identifying sites that are infringing according to §512 of the DMCA, the SITE shall attempt to contact or take other reasonable steps to contact the complaining party to help that party comply with the notice requirements. When the Designated Agent receives a valid notice, the SITE will expeditiously remove and/or disable access to the infringing material and shall notify the affected user. Then, the affected user may submit a counter-notification to the Designated Agent containing a statement made under penalty of perjury that the user has a good faith belief that the material was removed because of misidentification of the material. After the Designated Agent receives the counter-notification, it will replace the material at issue within 10-14 days after receipt of the counter-notification unless the Designated Agent receives notice that a court action has been filed by the complaining party seeking an injunction against the infringing activity. The SITE reserves the right to modify, alter or add to this policy, and all users should regularly check back to these Terms and Conditions to stay current on any such changes.

Service Provider Customers or Subscribers

In the event that the alleged infringer identified in an intended DMCA Notice is, itself, operating as a “Service Provider” within the meaning of 17 U.S.C. § 512(k)(1), the SITE requests that any such DMCA Notices relating to alleged infringement by third party users, customers or subscribers of such service providers be submitted directly to the DMCA Agent designated by the service provider instead of the SITE.

 

If you are under 18 years of age or if you feel uncomfortable on this site, please feel free to leave it.

    an electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright or other intellectual property interest;

    a description of where the material that you claim is infringing is located on the SITE, must include the specific url’s associated with each file;
    your address, telephone number, and email address;
    a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and,
